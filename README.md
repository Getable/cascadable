BETA VERSION (WORK IN PROGRESS)
===============================
LAST UPDATED OCTOBER 4, 2012 19:06 PST

Author's note: Cascadable is an internal project I started @Getable to standardize our web properties. 
I realize some of the form elements are not completely styled yet. 
At this point, it's great for establishing baselines for buttons, type, and essential HTML elements; 
or as a 'plug-and-play' CSS boilerplate for static web projects. Feel free to fork!
